Hi. My name is Eric and this is an application I have created using Ruby on Rails. Please follow the steps to run the app.


1. Run "rails db:migrate" in the terminal
2. Run the server by typing "rails s" into the terminal
3. Access the server at "http://localhost:3000"
4. Sign up for an account
5. Run "rails db:seed in the terminal
6. Refresh the page to see the predefined types or make your own


The application is intended to be a booking system where a user is able to make bookings using the predefined types or they could create their own types.
