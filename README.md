Hi. My name is Eric and this is an application I have created using Ruby on Rails. Please follow the steps to run the app.


1. Run "rails db:migrate" in the terminal
2. Run "rails db:seed in the terminal
3. Run the server by typing "rails s" into the terminal
4. Access the server at "http://localhost:3000"

The application is intended to be a booking system where a user is able to make bookings using the predefined types or they could create their own types.
